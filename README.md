This Robot will follow a black line.
If it recognises red color on its color sensor it stops for 2 seconds and continues.
If it detects an obstacle at a distance of 10cm. it stops until the obstacle is moved away.
If its pushed by any external force away from the line it rotates towards the line and continues on the line.
